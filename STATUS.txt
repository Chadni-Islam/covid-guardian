Reusable

Our github repository: https://github.com/covid-guardian/covid-guardian/

We are applying for the Reusable badge. This project is fully implemented based on our paper, An Empirical Assessment of
Global COVID-19 Contact Tracing Applications, with features including static vulnerability analysis, taint analysis and
virus checking.

We made two running modes: CLI and Web. CLI mode offers a batch analysis that allows users to analyse a set of apps
concurrently by giving the directory path. Web mode provides a user-friendly web page to upload apps and display results
on it. Both of two modes are fully featured.

The source codes are fully documented. All classes and functions are written with clean code guidance. We also left
comments on most of functions to help developers understand the logic.

Therefore, we believe our project deserves a Reusable badge.
